Week 1: Core Scan Types and Basic Indexing
Day 1-2: Index Scans

Run queries with simple INDEX SCAN operations (e.g., queries with WHERE on indexed columns).
Experiment with covering indexes, partially indexed columns, and compare execution plans.
Day 3-4: Bitmap Index Scans

Explore queries that trigger BITMAP INDEX SCAN and BITMAP HEAP SCAN.
Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) to study how data pages are accessed.
Compare performance with INDEX SCAN and SEQ SCAN on similar datasets.
Day 5-6: Index-only Scans

Create covering indexes (indexes that contain all columns needed in the query) and observe how INDEX ONLY SCAN is triggered.
Experiment with VACUUM to see how PostgreSQL uses visibility maps to skip reading certain pages.
Day 7: Summary and Review

Review and document your findings on scan types and indexes.
Week 2: Join Strategies and Optimizing Joins
Day 1-2: Nested Loop Joins

Run queries with small tables that trigger NESTED LOOP joins.
Analyze the impact of join order and indexed join columns.
Day 3-4: Hash Joins

Run joins on larger tables to explore HASH JOIN execution.
Experiment with WORK_MEM settings to see how memory affects in-memory hash tables and disk spill.
Day 5-6: Merge Joins

Study MERGE JOIN by running ordered joins.
Experiment with indexed joins to observe when PostgreSQL switches to merge join from hash join.
Day 7: Summary and Review

Document findings on join types, with examples of when each is optimal.
Week 3: Aggregates, Sorting, and Grouping
Day 1-2: Aggregation Strategies

Use aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) with and without indexes.
Observe HASHAGGREGATE vs. GROUPAGGREGATE and experiment with WORK_MEM to see its effect.
Day 3-4: Sorting

Run queries with ORDER BY on indexed and non-indexed columns.
Compare SORT node execution plans and study buffer usage.
Day 5-6: Grouping and Distinct

Run queries with GROUP BY and DISTINCT.
Observe the different methods PostgreSQL uses to handle grouping (HashAggregate, GroupAggregate, or Sort).
Day 7: Summary and Review

Document findings on aggregate strategies and sorting mechanisms.
Week 4: Advanced Techniques and Real-World Scenarios
Day 1-2: Subqueries and CTEs

Explore execution plans of subqueries and WITH CTEs (common table expressions).
Test materialized CTEs and non-materialized CTEs and observe their impact on execution time.
Day 3-4: Parallelism

Experiment with large tables and queries that trigger parallel plans (e.g., PARALLEL SEQ SCAN).
Adjust max_parallel_workers_per_gather and observe how parallelism affects query speed.
Day 5-6: Analyzing Query Costs and Buffers

Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) to break down I/O costs.
Experiment with increasing shared_buffers and work_mem to observe their effect on cost and execution times.
Day 7: Summary and Review

Summarize findings on advanced plan optimization and parallelism.
Weeks 5 and Beyond: Specialized Optimizations and Tuning
Advanced Indexing: Experiment with partial indexes, expression indexes, and unique constraints. Query Rewrites and Hints: Explore PostgreSQL hints and strategies to influence query plans. Real-World Scenarios: Analyze complex production queries to spot common pitfalls. Daily Practice: Continue with real-world query analysis and regular optimization practice.
