Recursive CTEs:
- Analyze execution plans for recursive CTEs and their performance on hierarchical data.

Subqueries with Window Functions:
- Investigate execution plans for subqueries or CTEs using window functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.

CTE/Subquery with LATERAL Joins:
- Test execution plans for subqueries or CTEs that use LATERAL
