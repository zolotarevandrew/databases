explain (analyze, verbose, costs, settings, buffers, wal, timing, summary) select * from bookings where book_ref = '00000F';

1) analyze - executes the query;
planning time - time spent analyzing and optimizing query before using it;
execution time - actual time to execute query;

2) verbose - show additional details of plan output (internal nodes etc)
adds - Output for each node (book_ref, book_date, total_amount);

3) costs - includes startup and total costs;
(cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=21) (actual time=0.016..0.017 rows=1 loops=1)
startup cost - 0.42, estimated time to produce first row;
total cost - 8.44, time to process all required rows to return;
rows - 1, expected rows to return based on statistics;
width - 21, estimated size of each row in output; 
actual start time - 0.016 ms, time to reach the first rows actual time;
actual end time - 0.017ms, actual time to output all rows;
actual rows - 1, actual rows returned;
loops - 1, number of times node was executed;

cpu_tuple_cost - Cost of processing each row in memory (default is typically 0.01);
cpu_index_tuple_cost - Cost of processing each row in an index scan;
seq_page_cost -  Cost of sequentially scanning a page from disk (default is 1.0);
random_page_cost -  Cost of a random disk page access (default is 4.0, higher to reflect the inefficiency of random I/O);

4) settings - showing custom configuration settings (work_mem, maintenance_work_mem)
adds - Settings: search_path = 'bookings, bookings, public'

5) buffers - tracks disk+ memory i/o for each pipeline
adds - Buffers: shared hit=4

hit - found hit in buffer cache;
read - has to fetch page from disk, it is not in buffer cache;
dirtied - pages is dirtied, needing to write to disk;
written - written back to disk;

shared buffers - buffer cache;
local buffers - local buffers;
temporary buffers - sort/hash joins etc
  
6) wal, timing, summary - useless with analyze;
