Bitmap Index Scan - Building a Bitmap of Matching Rows (reads through the index in this case)

Bitmap Heap Scan fetches the data in bulk by accessing pages marked in the bitmap, reducing the number of random I/O operations.
In this plan, Heap Blocks: exact=3780 indicates that 3,780 pages (blocks) were accessed to retrieve the rows that matched the index condition.

The Recheck Condition is essential in bitmap scans. 
It re-evaluates the condition (total_amount > 100000.00) on each row in the selected pages to ensure they actually meet the condition.

This step is necessary because the Bitmap Index Scan initially only checks the index entries, 
which can sometimes lead to "false positives" where pages contain rows that donâ€™t fully satisfy the condition.

Recheck cond -  PostgreSQL may switch to a lossy bitmap format. In a lossy bitmap, instead of marking individual row locations, 
PostgreSQL marks entire pages (blocks) where matches are found. 
This saves memory but means some pages might contain non-matching rows.


Heap Blocks: exact=6 indicates that only 6 blocks were accessed to retrieve all 28 rows. 
This is much more efficient than potentially accessing each row's block individually.
