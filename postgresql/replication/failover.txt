If the primary server fails then the standby server should begin failover procedures.
If the standby server fails then no failover need take place. 
If the standby server can be restarted, even some time later, then the recovery process can also be restarted immediately, taking advantage of restartable recovery. 
If the standby server cannot be restarted, then a full new standby server instance should be created.

PostgreSQL does not provide the system software required to identify a failure on the primary and notify the standby database server.
