Violations
- Mixing data types within in a single column (different strings for example).
- design table without a primary key.
- repeating groups (mixing strings in one column).

player_id, item_type, item_quantity

2 NF

player_id, item_type, item_quantity, rating

deleting all rows by player - means we don't have rating anymore - (deletion anomaly).
updarting rating by player can fail for some rows, two different rating for same player - (updating anomaly).
we have a new player with beginner rating,  but he doesnt have any inventory items - (insertion anomaly).

Each non-key attribute must depend on the entire primary key.

Functional dependency
{player_id, item_type} -> {quantity}
{player_id} -> {rating}

player table
player, rating

3 NF

player_id, rating, skill_level (1-9)

Beginner - 1-3
Intermediate - 4-6
Advanced - 7-9

skill level was 3, we updated to 4, but rating stays as Beginner..

{player_id} -> {skill_level}
{player_id} -> {skill_level} -> {rating} - transitive dependency.


player
player, player_skill_level

player_skill_levels
skill_level, rating

Every non-key atrribute in a table should depend on the key, the whole key,
and nothing but key.

tbd - boyce codd normal form?
